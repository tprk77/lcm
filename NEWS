July 14, 2010
=============

 Release 0.5.1:

 This is a bugfix release, affecting only the Windows port.

 Windows:
 Fix lcmgen Visual Studio project file - missing emit_csharp.c
 Add a .NET tutorial and some some C# examples

===========

 Release 0.5.0:

 This release introduces experimental support for C# / .NET, provided by 
 Jan Hrbáček.  Bug reports and patches are greatly appreciated.

 This release also introduces a small python API change, and renames a program
 in windows.  

 Additional bugfixes are included.

 Windows:
 - Now builds lcm-gen.exe, not lcmgen.exe

 .NET:
 - The lcm-dotnet/ directory contains a publish-subscribe library for
   .NET applications.
 
 lcm-gen:
 - (C#) A new set of options are available for generating C# bindings
 - (Python) change __init__.py import statements.  If a package named 'proj'
   contains the LCM type msg_t, then the __init__.py file now contains:
     from msg_t import msg_t
   and the recommended usage pattern is:
     import proj
     instance = proj.msg_t()
   see googlecode issue #21
 - (Windows, Java) fix pathname bug

 Other:
 - minor build system bugfixes

Mar 11, 2010
============

 Release 0.4.1:

 This is a bugfix and maintenance release.

 Updated documentation for single host use, to describe how to use LCM over the
 localhost interface.

 C:
 - fix leaking file descriptors
 - fix OS/X compile bug for lcm-example (missing #include <sys/select.h>)
 - simplify project include path requirements in Windows
 - update error checking, messages for single host use (Linux)

 Java:
 - expose encode/decode methods for advanced users

 lcm-gen:
  - (C) add --c-no-pubsub command line option to lcm-gen to generate C language
    bindings without a dependency on liblcm (useful if only the marshalling
    aspect of LCM is desired).
  - (Java) don't complain about default pkg if one is specified on cmd line.

 lcm-spy:
 - remember last message on each channel so that object panels open up
   immediately.
 - put frames in front when double clicked.

 Other:
 - remove manpage-specific GFDL copyright notices.

===========

 Release 0.4.0:

 This release introduces experimental support for Microsft Visual C++, provided
 by Randy Sybel.  The LCM C bindings and examples should now compile with MSVC.
 Bug reports and patches are greatly appreciated.

 There are also a number of bugfixes in the Java port.  See the changelog for
 details.

Aug 14, 2009
============

 Release 0.3.1:

 This is a maintenance release, and incorporates a number of minor bugfixes and
 enhancements.

 Java:
 - lcm-spy, lcm-logplayer-gui warn if gcj is detected as JRE
 - minor enhancements to lcm-spy

 Python:
 - update comment docs

 Other:
 - add --lcm-url=URL cmd line option to lcm-{spy,logger,logplayer,logplayer-gui}
 - updated examples

Jun 29, 2009
============

 Release 0.3.0:

 Java
   Faster serialization classes that provide a 4x-5x speedup.  This introduces
   a backwards-incompatible change to the LCM Java API.  Specifically, 
   the messageReceived() method of the LCMSubscriber interface has changed
   from:

    public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, DataInputStream ins)

   to:
  
    public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, LCMDataInputStream ins)

   LCMDataInputStream has an almost identical API to DataInputStream, and
   migration of source code to the new API should only require changing
   implementations of LCMSubscriber in the manner described above.

 C
    warn on Linux if large packets are being received but the kernel rbuf is
    small

 Python
   bugfix for decoding arrays of bytes

Nov 9, 2008
===========

    Release 0.1.1:

    * C: Modify "file://" provider so that lcm_handle returns -1 on EOF.
      Suppress warning messages when event numbers in a logfile are not 
      consecutive
    * C: change uint8_t* to void* in lcm_recv_buf, lcm_publish, and 
      lcm_eventlog_t
    * lcm-logger: add option to log only channels matching a regex
    * lcm-gen: bugfixes in emitted Java code
    * lcm-gen: add -jdefaultpkg option for emitted Java code, changed default
      behavior.

Aug 29, 2008
============

    Release 0.1.0:

    New features

    * Added const declaration to .lcm specification.
    * Removed transmit_only option from LCM URL.  All LCM instances are now 
      considered transmit only until a channel subscription is made.
    * Added LCM_DEFAULT_URL environment variable.  If the LCM URL is not 
      specified during instantiation, and LCM_DEFAULT_URL is defined, then 
      that is used as the LCM URL initialization string.
    * Added documentation for LCM type specification language.
    * Added close method to Java LCM class.

    Deprecations

    * enum is now deprecated in the .lcm specification.  Current implementations
      will be left functional, but enums will no longer be documented or supported
      in future releases.  At some point in the distant future they may be 
      completely removed.  Use of const instead of enums is now recommended.

    Bugfixes

    * Java: fix enum types.  This breaks the API for compiled Java enum types.
      Changed java enum value field from private to public so that raw
      numerical value is accessible.
    * C: lcm_udp bugfix to eliminate a corner-case infinite loop.
    * C: add mutex to allow only one thread in lcm_handle at a time.

May 5, 2008
===========

    Release 0.0.5:

    * Fix minor issue in lcm-gen for parsing oddly formatted files 
      (those missing token delimiters at EOF)
    * Fix Python enum types.  This breaks the API for compiled Python enum
      types.
    * fix VERSION bug in ac_python_devel.m4 (affects OS X)
    * Remove a DGC hack that skipped over log gaps > 0.25 seconds
    * Try to make JAR file only contain class files, by using build directory
    * make lcm-spy more robust to receipt of non-lcm autogenerated types

Mar 21, 2008
============

    Release 0.0.4:

    * Portability improvements.  Core functionality is now tested on FreeBSD,
      Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris 10, and cygwin.
    * Added command line tool lcm-logplayer
    * Renamed GUI lcm-jlogplayer to lcm-logplayer-gui
